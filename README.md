# SecretSanta
A Campus Wide Secret Santa Project!


This Christmas, we want everyone at Cornell to enjoy the festive season by participating in a campus-wide Secret Santa gift exchange!

The app was built using React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We used Google Firebase for our database and for hosting. 

Our matching algorithm was developed in Python. 

-----
[Frontend Folder]
The frontend folder contains all the instructions needed to run the React App, as well as detailed instructions on using Create React App.

Remember to `npm install -i` before attempting to run the Application. 

-----
[Algo Folder]
The algo folder contains the algorithm that we will be using to match people during the Secret Santa exchange. 

This is still under development.
