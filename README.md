# SecretSanta
A Campus Wide Secret Santa Project!


This Christmas, we want everyone at Cornell to enjoy the festive season by participating in a campus-wide Secret Santa gift exchange!

The app was built using React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We used Google Firebase for our database and for hosting. 

Our matching algorithm was developed in Python.
